    question: "What to eat before and after a workout?",
    answer: `Firstly, make sure that you ate your last large meal 2-3 hours before your workout. Otherwise, you can feel uncomfortable whilst training

Consuming some simple carbohydrates about an hour prior to working out is a great habit to get into – think fresh or dried fruit, some granola, or a cereal bar. This will provide you with some readily available energy during your session.

Post workout, you need to re-build and refuel. Slower releasing carbohydrates to replenish any lost muscle glycogen – or glucose – along with protein helps kickstart the muscle rebuilding process

Foods such as brown pasta, brown rice and potatoes for your carbohydrates, and meats such as fish or chicken and beans, and pulses for your protein.`,

    question: "What type of training increases muscle mass?",
    answer: `Resistance training is likely the best training modality to increase muscle mass.

Completing some form of resistance training 2-3 times a week is a great place to start if you’re new to this type of training.

As a beginner sticking to compound movements – squats, deadlifts, rows and presses – as they target multiple muscle groups.

Be sure to stick to correct form and be sure to gradually increase the weight or difficulty of an exercise variation you choose over time to build muscle.`,
